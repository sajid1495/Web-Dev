# Web Development Projects

Welcome to my Frontend Development Projects repository! This repository contains all the code and projects I've created while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is organized into its own folder, and I've included descriptions and usage instructions where applicable.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my journey in learning web development. Each project demonstrates different skills and techniques, from basic HTML structure to advanced JavaScript interactions.
